abstract = "Today, many companies see open innovation - a process for sharing knowledge and ideas with other organizations - as a core part of their strategy for developing new offerings. Oddly, however, although both the depth and breadth of intercompany collaboration continues to increase, the actual adoption of the ideas developed this way does not seem to be rising at the same pace. Multiple gatekeepers, skepticism regarding anything "not invented here," and turf wars all hold back adoption. Independent design agencies, whose survival depends ultimately on their clients' using their ideas, have long faced this same challenge. They have developed a variety of techniques to encourage clients to adopt their concepts. In this article, we present these techniques."
