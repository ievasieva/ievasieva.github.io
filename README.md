Hi there!

My name is Ieva, and this is the draft of my dissertation on business model design for paradoxical goals in creative industries. I am writing in RStudio because I use R to do my data analysis. Also, it is easy to do updates based on version control and I like the ease of referencing. 

The code used for this manuscript is based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Please see the page "Get Started" at https://bookdown.org/ for how to compile this example. 

Please note that this is an unpublished draft version of my work, and if interested, please email me at i.rozentale@uva.nl on how to reference it accordingly.
