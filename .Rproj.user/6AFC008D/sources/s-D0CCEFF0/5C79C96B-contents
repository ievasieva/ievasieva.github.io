The reformulated research question:

Three studies
========================================================

1. When confronted with paradoxical goals, how do firms make decisions about their business models?   
2. How do differentiation and integration decisions within different business model elements lead to (mis-) balanced performance in conflicting domains?  
3. What combinations of business models and strategic orientations lead to success in both of the conflicting performance domains?
