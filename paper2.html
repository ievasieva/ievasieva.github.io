<p><strong>UNRAVELING SUCCESFUL CONFIGURATIONS FOR ACHIEVING CONFLICTING GOALS</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Contemporary firms often have to work towards achieving contradictory performance-criteria (Denis et al., 2007), and this requires designing complex business models (Smith et al., 2013). Paradox management, ambidexterity, and business model literature has identified several separate strategies at the business model level that would help tackling this challenge - portfolio differentiation (Andriopoulos and Lewis, 2009), client segmentation (Bednarek et al., 2106), finding complementary partners (Yunus et al., 2010), multi-sided revenue models (Osterwalder &amp; Pigneur, 2010), and venture separation (Markides &amp; Charitou, 2004, DeFillippi, 2015). However, it is not clear how these strategies combine, and if they can be linked to high performance. This article aims to identify the configurations of business model related decisions that are necessary and/or sufficient for performing well in two conflicting domains simultaneously. Our study is based on a comparative case survey of business modelling practices of 140 Dutch creative service firms (e.g. design agencies, advertisement firms, architecture firms). We leverage paradox theory and configurational methods to conceptualize business models as a combination integrating and separating decisions directed towards the two conflicting goals, in our case - creative and commercial success. Our results, based in a fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative analysis (fsQCA), show which business model configurations 1) contribute to a high performance in both conflicting strategic goals, 2) lead to a misbalance towards either creative or commercial performance, and 3) are representative of firms that score low on both performance dimensions.</p>

<p>The business model has proven to be a useful concept for explaining how firms create value (Magretta, 2002) and outperform each other (Afuah, 2004; Zott and Amit, 2007). According to the business model perspective, they do so by converting their goals (Smith et al., 2010) into better-performing configurations of decisions about value propositions, target markets, value creation mechanisms and revenue models (Baden-Fuller and Mangematin, 2013; Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010) than those of their competitors. While viewing firms in terms of business models has helped managers, as well as researchers to understand and articulate better the processes of value creation and capture, the literature has been surprisingly over-focused on explaining the economic value creation (Massa et al., 2017), and very limited attention has been paid to understanding business models in cases were firms have to generate other value than profit.</p>
<p>As recently discussed in various theoretical domains, e.g. paradox theory, institutional logics, organizational pluralism, or triple-bottom line, more and more contemporary firms are compelled to satisfy competing, even conflicting demands at the same time (Bednarek et al., 2017, Besharov and Smith (2014)). The common examples of other performance goals alongside profit-making include social (Smith et al., 2013) and environmental missions (Dixon and Clifford, 2007), corporate social responsibility (Wong and Dhanesh, 2017), multiple stakeholder satisfaction (Jarzabkowski et al., 2013), or creative performance, as in the case of the research setting of this study - the creative service firms (Jacobs, 2013). The long-term success and competitive advantage of firms facing conflicting demands depend heavily on their ability to strike a balance in these different domains (Smith, 2014). The question is then - how can firms build business models that are able to manage conflicting goals simultaneously?</p>
<p>One can find empirical and theorerical suggestions on different strategies for managing conflicting goals applicable at the business model level in prior literature on corporate venturing, business models, and paradox management. Markides and Charitou (2004) have explored the conditions under which it would beneficial to create separate ventures for business models having different strategic intents. Andriopoulos and Lowe (2000) observed that design firms shift between projects aimed at financial goals and employee satisfaction; DeFillippi (2015) argued that in the context of media companies, vertical value chain integration of smaller production companies into bigger media businesses can help firms to tackle the ambidexterity challenge; Yunus et al. (2010) discussed the benefits of separate social and marketing networks in the context of social enterprises; Grassl (2012) examined the use of different revenue mechanisms for different client groups in hybrid organizations.</p>
<p>Given their interdependent nature, such “design choices in business model components cannot be considered in isolation but should be balanced in order to develop a viable business model” (Haaker et al., 2006). While the identified strategies undoubtedly can help firms to grapple the challenge of satisfying multiple performance crieria simultaneously, it is unknow how they combine. It is thus the aim of this article to unravel how these different business model level strategies combine for high performance in pluralistic (dual performance) settings.</p>
<p>In order to reach our research objective, we first leverage insights from paradox literature to build a theoretical framework of business modelling for conflicting goals. According to paradox theory, integration and separation are the two generic organizational and individual responses to conflicting demands. We examine prior studies that show how these are applied with respect to four business model elements - content of the value proposition, client and market selection, network organization, and revenue model. Based on prior business model studies, we also include venture separation as a variable in our analyses. We study survey data on business modeling practices of 140 Dutch creative service firms. Using Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), we examine 1) how the identified separation / integration practices at different business model elements combine for achieving high creative and commercial performance; 2) which configurations can explain scoring low on one or both of the performance dimensions.</p>
<p><span style="color:red">The contribution of this paper is three-fold: 1) Confirming the theoretical assumptions of paradox theory, our results show that firms that rely only on one of the strategies throughout their business models underperform in one of the performance dimensions. 2) The findings equally deepen our understanding of business models, emphasizing that specific business model elements change their importance in combination with other elements. 3) They show how neoconfigurational methods can be used in order to study business models beyond single cases.</span></p>
<p>The remainder of the paper unfolds as follows: first, we combine business model and paradox literature to build the conceptual model and formulate hypotheses. Second, the data, sample, and the suitability and application of configurational methods are explained. Finally, we discuss the results, conclusions, and implications for further research and practice.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Theoretical background and conceptual framework</h2>
<p>In order to build our conceptual model, we embed the study of business models in two increasingly prominent meta-theoretical approaches, namely, paradox theory (e.g. Poole and Van de Ven, 1989; Schad et al., 2016; Smith and Lewis, 2011) and configurational theory (Fiss et al., 2013; Misangyi et al., 2017; e.g. Snow et al., 2006). Paradox theory provides a lens for understanding how business models can serve as a device for managing conflicting demands. Configurational approach offers both theoretical and methodic tools that allow for better conceptualization and analysis of business models and their relationship to paradoxes. In this section, we explain how we connect the first two perspectives. Configurational approach is discussed in the methods section.</p>
<div id="business-models-and-firm-performance" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Business models and firm performance</h3>
<p>A business model explains how firms “create, deliver and capture value” (Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010, p. 14). More specifically, it can be defined as “the design by which an organization converts a given set of strategic choices - about markets, customers, value propositions - into value, and uses a particular organizational architecture - of people, competencies, processes, culture and measurement systems - in order to create and capture this value” (Smith et al., 2010, p. 450).</p>
<p>Studying firms from a business model perspective emerged as an alternative way of conceptualizing and describing how firms do business (Magretta, 2002). When compared to earlier perspectives, such as resourced-based view or industrial organization, the business model perspective focuses on “voluntary choices over environmental conditions” (Demil et al., 2015). The business model thus reflects the decisions firms make about their products, markets, resource organization and revenue models. By making these decisions, firms create mechanisms or systems that transform their strategic goals and needs into value.</p>
<p>While a considerable body of work has been dedicated to developing component-based conceptual frameworks for the study of business models (Osterwalder et al., 2005; Wirtz et al., 2016), no agreement on one single conceptualization has been reached among the scholars. Notwithstanding the disagreements, in line with the given definitions, most studies commonly distinguish four basic domains or components of business models:<br />
- <em>Value proposition</em> describes the basic features of the offering, the type of value it is generating and the perceived basis of differentiation from competitors.<br />
- <em>Value delivery</em> describes the demand side or the customer infrastructure that the firm builds - its target markets and customers to whom the value is delivered; how they are acquired and reached.<br />
- <em>Value creation</em> depicts the supply side of the firm, namely, what internal and external resources, activities and structures are needed to generate the value proposition.<br />
- <em>Value capture</em> describes the financial aspects of the firm’s value mechanisms <span class="citation">(Morris, Schindehutte, and Allen <a href="#ref-Morris2005">2005</a>; Osterwalder, Pigneur, and Tucci <a href="#ref-Osterwalder2005">2005</a>; Teece <a href="#ref-Teece2010">2010</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Research, as well as evidence from the practice show that successful combinations of decisions in these four domains can grant firms advantage over competitors and explain performance differentials (Zott and Amit, 2008, 2007). This can take place in different ways. Firms can use superior business model designs upon the commercializing of new technology (Chesbrough and Rosenbloom, 2002). Business models can also be subject to innovation themselves, as firms either create new ways of delivering and capturing value in established industries (Mason and Spring, 2011; Teece, 2010), or respond to the changes in their competitive environments through business model adaptation (Volberda and Lewin, 2003). Some authors have even gone so far to say that the future quest of sustainable competitive advantage lies in business models (Casadesus-Masanell and Ricart, 2011). However, just as most of the strategic literature (De Wit and Meyer, 2010), also the literature on business models has largely ignored the fact that firms might have a purpose beyond profit-maximization (Massa et al., 2017). Apart from setting-specific studies in fields like social entrepreneurship (Grassl, 2012) or sustainability (Bohnsack et al., 2014), business models are mostly studied as strategic decisions that help to create economic value (Magretta, 2002).</p>
</div>
<div id="organizational-goals-pluralism-and-paradoxes-of-performing" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Organizational goals, pluralism and paradoxes of performing</h3>
<p>Despite the dominance of profit-maximization paradigm, firms increasingly aspire or are compelled to create other value than the economic, e.g. social, stakeholder, environmental, and hence are pursuing several objectives simultaneously. Diverse research agendas have addressed this phenomenon, including institutional theory, triple-bottom-line, and organizational hybridity. Since our interest lies in the way managers make strategic decisions about business models, particularly, when there are conflicts and incompatibilities across the demands firms face, we leverage literature on pluralism and organizational paradoxes.</p>
<p>The concept or organizational pluralism is used to describe contexts that are characterized by “multiple objectives, diffuse power and knowledge-based work processes” (Denis et al., 2007, p. 180). Pluralism arises as a result of “the divergent goals and interests of different groups, each of which have sufficient power bases to ensure that their goals are legitimate to the strategy of the organization” (Jarzabkowski and Fenton, 2006, p. 631). Pluralism can find its source both within and outside the organization. For instance, in the case of professional service firms, the need to retain highly skilled employees often requires managers to act against the market interests, as the profitable work is not always the most interesting one, but the skilled professionals need to be challenged enough to be motivated to perform well (Teece, 2003). In hybrid organizations, such as hospitals or universities, competing demands are created by the need to satisfy different stakeholder groups like funding bodies, regulatory institutions, and different client groups (Denis et al., 2007).</p>
<p>While most settings exhibit some levels of pluralism, in particularly salient settings, it can create what paradox scholars refer to as performing or strategic paradoxes - “contradictions in organizational objectives based on the divergent definitions of success held by important stakeholders” (Bednarek et al., 2017, p.80). Strategic paradoxes are characterized by conflict, incompatibility, and interdependence (Jarzabkowski et al., 2013). The multitude of stakeholders and competing goals surface tensions as the individuals struggle to make conflicting decisions, and carry out conflicting tasks and roles simultaneously (Jarzabkowski et al., 2013; Luscher and Lewis, 2008). Moreover, since they are all legitimate, making choices is impossible. To examplify, scientific institutions face strategic paradoxes, as their sustainability depends on the long-term ability of producing excellent research, as well as the short-term immediate capacity of creating societal and commercial impact by providing educational services and commercializing research results (Bednarek et al., 2017). Other examples of settings in which strategic paradoxes are dominant include the ambidextrous firms, social enterprises, learning organizations (Smith et al., 2010), and also the setting of this study - the creative industries firms, whose success is defined both in creative and commercial terms, yet each requires conflicting decisions, resources and structures to be implemented (DeFillippi et al., 2007; Jacobs, 2012).</p>
<p>Strategic paradoxes are particularly influential for they penetrate the whole organization, having immediate implications for management and organization, and thereby determine firm performance and the ability to sustain itself in the long run (Jarzabkowski and Fenton, 2006; Smith, 2014). With respect to performance evaluation, strategic paradoxes create what we could call the double-success criterion (Jacobs, 2013) or double performance standards. Literature on social entrepreneurship, corporate social responsibility, sustainability, and triple-bottom-line has argued that performance measures in such increasingly complex settings have to be extended beyond profit to include measures concerning, for instance, social performance, environmental performance, markets, customers, internal processes, and learning and development (Hubbard, 2009). The question within the context of our research is - how can firms deal with paradoxes of performing when designing their business models?</p>

</div>
<p>According to paradox scholars, complex strategic demands and aspirations require designing “complex business models” that would be able to accommodate the confliciting demands (Smith et al., 2013). The business model literature holds no immediate answers explaining the workings of such complex business models. To build the conceptual framwork, we levarage three key insights from paradox theory.</p>
<p>First, not all strategic conflicts can be framed in terms of choice. In line with the literature on pluralism, since all conflicting objectives are legitimate, a choice cannot be made. Instead, firms have to adopt what is referred to as the both/and approach to managing (Smith, 2014). It opposes the more traditional contingency approaches and trade-off thinking, which imply that strategic conflicts can only be resolved by a choice. “The core premise is not problem solving through fit, but coexistence”(Lewis and Smith, 2014, p. 3). According to the both/and perspective, success of firms that face strategic paradoxes will depend on their ability to accept the paradoxical nature of their objectives and learning how to cope with them. As paradoxes are not only conflicting, but also interdependent and persistent over time, making choice in favor of one objective, would never solve the situation, as the neglected objective one will resurface eventually. This means that instead of solving situations, paradoxes have to be managed (Smith, 2011).</p>
<p>Second, managing paradoxes implies that with respect to goals and performance evaluation they are enacting a balancing act - attempting to balance the performance in paradoxical domains over time. According to our qualitative interviews, in practice this usually manifests as requirement that the performance in all relevant domains over time is 1) above the “break-even” point, and 2) equally well attained. The operationalization of performance balance is further discussed in the methods section.</p>
<p>Third, paradox theory offers meta-thoeretical models explaining the ways managers apply considerations about conflicting goals in their decision-making. According to most paradox research (Smith and Lewis, 2011), there are the two generic approaches a firm can adapt in its decisions, structures, and contexts in order to cope with paradoxes - integration and separation (or differentiation). Differentiation approach to paradox management prescribes dealing with tensions through segmentation and/or source splitting, e.g. establishing separate units, teams, even ventures, leadership structures, processes, segmenting and shifting between activities over time (Poole and Van de Ven, 1989; Fairhurst et al., 2016). Integration approach implies searching for compromise in terms of middle-way or solutions that embrace both poles (Fairhurst et al., 2016), e.g. hiring all-around employees that adhere to both visions (O’Reilly and Tushman, 2013), or building common organizational value system through communication of strategic goals (Kolsteeg, 2014).</p>

<img src="Figure%202.2.png" alt="Business modelling for conflicting goals." width="487" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:fig2.2)Business modelling for conflicting goals.
</p>
</div>
<p>When synthesizing these insights conceptually, the process of business model design changes from that presented in the Figure 1 to a more complex one, presented in Figure 2. Visually, the only difference between business modelling for profit-maximization and for strategic paradoxes is the addition of an extra goal dimension, and, consequently, an extra performance dimension. However, the fact that more than one goals is driving decision-making and potentially even creating conflicts changes as seemingly incompatible decisions might be made, changes the very nature of the business modelling process. While in the first case business model design can be viewed as a process of optimizing, in the second it resembles for a process of compromising and balancing. The goals are expected to be directly reflected in the business model decisions, and they can either accommodate both goals simultaneously (integrate) or separately (differentiate). This would not be the case, in case there would be only one goal.</p>

<div id="the-analytical-model-and-hypotheses" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> The analytical model and hypotheses</h2>
<p>As already highlighted in the introduction, there is evidence in prior literature that firms use the integration and separation strategies with respect to the decisions that compose their business models. The studies are slightly “hidden” in that they usually lack one of the theoretical components of our study - either they rely on paradox theory and only implicitly discuss some aspects of business modelling (e.g. Andriopoulos and Lowe, 2000; DeFillippi, 2015, 2009), or they study business models in the light of similar questions as discussed in the paradox literature, without using the paradox theory to explain them (Markides and Charitou, 2004; Markides, 2013; Yunus et al., 2010). In order to build our framework, we searched literature for evidence of firms using integration / differentiation strategies in the general domains of business models outlined previously - content of value proposition, clients and markets, resource organization (aka value creation) and revenue model. Some insights on how this takes place also came from our interviews. This process leads us to select five most common strategies that we will use in our analysis.</p>
<div id="venture-separation" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> Venture separation</h3>
<p>Structural separation is probably the most commonly explored strategy for dealing with strategic paradoxes, particularly widely discussed in the ambidexterity literature, where the authors have suggested to create separate units or even ventures for pursuing innovation activities, such as R&amp;D, as opposed to exploitation activities (O’Reilly and Tushmann, 2004). In the creative industries literature, DeFillippi (2015) highlighted the practice of media businesses having “created a diverse set of production studios, some of which specialize in more innovative, idiosyncratic projects for which there is a less clear link to established franchises, IP and their associated user groups whereas other studios focus on more mass market franchises that exploit existing IP.” (p.17)</p>
<p>In the business model literature, this issue has been addressed under the discussion of whether business models that are designed for different competitive strategies can be accommodate in a single firm or not. According, to Markides and Charitou (2004), “separation is the preferred strategy when the new market is not only strategically different from the existing business but also when the two markets face serious tradeoffs and conflicts.” (p.24) The authors further argue that in cases where strategic intents and markets are similar, the existing infrastructure and the business model of the focal firm is enough. Since, in the case of paradoxical strategies, there is a conflict, we could expect that firms who have spun off either commercial or creative activities in other affiliated ventures will be able to score high on both performance dimensions. Accordingly, if they have not done so, they will require implementing other strategies in their business models that allow them to cope with the strategic paradox.</p>
<p><em>Hypothesis 1a:</em> The application of paradoxical venture separation is an individually sufficient condition for high creative and commercial performance.<br />
<em>Hypothesis 1b:</em> The absence of paradoxical venture separation will require other paradox management strategies to be implemented at the business model of the focal firm (INUS condition).</p>
</div>
<div id="portfolio-diversification" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.2</span> Portfolio diversification</h3>
<p>Internal to firm, one of the main business model choices for firms is that of their value offering - the portfolio of services and/or products that they provide. Prior research in ambidexterity (Andriopoulos and Lewis, 2009; ) and creative industries (Bettiol et al., 2012; DeFillippi, 2015) has shown that diversifying the portfolio to include offering that tackle the different strategic intents separately can help to effectively target conflicting performance objectives. Earlier research in innovation management (Wheelwright and Clark, 1992) has similarly suggested “aggregate project plans” that would include both profitable and high-risk projects. Moreover, not only has research found evidence to diversification in terms of horizontal offering, but also adding extra value chain activities to address different needs (Winterhalter et al., 2016). ###Client segmentation<br />
According to Teece (2010), all business model design starts by selecting clients. Even in enterprises that have single strategic intents dual client segments are not uncommon, especially in platform models where one user group gets a service for free, while another segment pays for the access to this user base (Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010). In the context of ambidexterity of knowledge intensive firms, Bednarek et al. (2016) demonstrated that client segmentation allows to tackle both exploration and exploitation over time through acquiring different knowledge in different client relationships. Similarly, Andripolous (2003) found evidence that managers in NPD design firms switch between different types of clients that are either commercially, or creatively interesting.</p>
</div>
<div id="network-differentiation" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.3</span> Network differentiation</h3>
<p>Another way of attending to dual goals in the business model is through acquiring resources for the different strategic intents through separate networks. Yunus et al. (2010) illustrated this strategy in the case of business modelling for social enterprises. The authors argued that in order to build both social and commercial value, it is vital to attract complementary partners that have the skills and now-how not readily available to the firm. Baden-Fuller and Haefliger (2013) have discussed this in more theoretical terms, suggesting that two-sidedness at the value offering of business models also requires two-sided value chains and networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="dual-revenue-models" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.4</span> Dual revenue models</h3>
<p>Finally, benefits of separation have also been underlined with respect to revenue models, where different types of monetization would be applied for groups providing different value for the firm. For instance, the one-for-one revenue model of social enterprises like TOMS has showed how different intentions can be reach through different payment (or free) versions for different groups that cross-subsidize each other (Marquis and Park, 2014). In more traditional profit settings, Andriopoulos and Lewis (2009) exemplified how firms would do own investments in more innovative projects, while stick to classic budgeting practices for the more commercial ones.</p>
</div>
<div id="balancing-the-balancing-act" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.5</span> Balancing the balancing act</h3>
<p>Since the conceptual framework has not been previously tested, it is impossible to formulate precise configurational hypotheses about the relationship between different variables in our model. While most of the business model research would suggest that the last four differentiation strategies outlined before would have to be all implemented in the same time, thus creating two-sided business models (Baden-Fuller and Haefliger, 2013), literature also argues that the multi-sidedness throughout the business model is very complex to implement successfully (Permentier and Gandia, 2017). In accordance with this conclusion, more recent studies in paradox research suggest that it not enough to apply only differentiation strategies (Smith, 2014). Paradoxically, in order to balance conflicting strategic intents, both integration and differentiation are needed. Differentiating allows understanding the individual contributions and demands of each strategic goal, while integrating motivates finding ways to link the two. If both are not used, one of the functions is missing and the firms fail to continuously commit to both poles.<br />
While we did not find much discussions on integration strategies applied at the business model level, hence also they are absent from our model, we can expect that the absence of the implementation of a differentiation strategy means that the firm is at least to some extent trying to integrate both conflicting goals in its decision-making about business models. Combining these insights, we can formulate the following general hypotheses:</p>
<p><em>Hypothesis 2a:</em> Balanced performance patterns will be result from business model designs that rely on a mix of both presence and absence of differentiation strategies. <em>Hypothesis 2b:</em> Unbalanced performance patterns will result from business model designs that only rely on presence or absence of differentiation strategies.</p>
<p>Finally, given the interdependent nature of business modelling decision, we also expect that no single variable, except for venture separation, is individually necessary and or sufficient for reaching high performance in both domains. This means that we expect all configurations to consist of at least two conditions. This property of variables only jointly forming sufficient configurations is referred to INUS nature of a condition (variable) in QCA - insufficient but nonredundant parts of different configurations, which are themselves unnecessary but sufficient for the occurrence of the outcome (Fiss et al., 2013). Hence, we propose that:</p>
<p><em>Hypothesis 3:</em> Portfolio diversification, client segmentation, network differentiation, and dual revenue models are INUS conditions for achieving high creative and commercial performance simultaneously.</p>

<div id="methods-and-data" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Methods and data</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction, this study takes a configurational perspective to organizational success. In order to reach our research objective, we carried out a particular form of configurational analyses - the fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). We investigated how five business model design choices described in the analytical model of the previous section - portfolio diversification, client segmentation, differentiated network organization, revenue model diversification, and differentiation through venture creation - interact to lead to (mis) balance between financial and creative returns. In our research design and analysis, we followed the work of Fiss (2011; 2007), Ragin (2009), Schenider and Wagemann (2012), and Schneider and Rohlfing (2013).</p>
<div id="qca-and-its-suitability-for-the-study-of-business-models-and-paradox-management" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> QCA and its suitability for the study of business models and paradox management</h3>
<p>Configurational perspective is based on the assumption that “cases under study [are] constellations of interconnected elements” (Misangyi et al., 2017, p. 256). QCA belongs to a family of comparative configurational methods (CCM) that allows for a systematical analysis of comparable cases to identify causally relevant structural conditions (variables) that lead to an identified outcome (Marx et al., 2013; Thiem et al., 2015). As such, QCA is a case-oriented, as opposed to variable-oriented methods (Marx et al., 2013). It is equally a set-theoretic method, employing a causes-to-effects approach to examine combinations of causal conditions instead of the more traditional search for linear causation (Mahoney and Goertz, 2006).</p>
<p>QCA thus assists in answering questions that imply configurations, e.g. what factors (X, Z, etc.) combine to cause an outcome (Y)? More precisely it looks at what conditions or combinations of conditions are necessary and/or sufficient for an outcome to occur. Necessary conditions are present whenever we observe an outcome. Sufficient conditions are conditions that display the presence of an outcome whenever the conditions are present. As all configurational methods, also QCA is based on three main assumptions: 1) relationships to outcomes are nonlinear and asymmetric; 2) variables that are causally related in one configuration are not necessarily related in others, implying complex causality; and 3) configurations can be equifinal (Fiss, 2011, 2007).</p>
<p>When applying QCA in organization studies, variables (also referred to as conditions) are defined in terms of sets of organizational attributes. The choice of conditions can be both theoretical and empirical, namely, based on the knowledge of cases and the setting (Schneider and Rohlfing, 2013). A set can be a single condition or a combination of conditions. Each case (firm’s response, in our case) is expressed in terms of its membership to the defined sets. For this study, we have chosen to carry out a fuzzy set QCA (fsQCA). In fsQCA cases are not only expressed in their full membership to the sets (1 is in, 0 is out), but also partial memberships can be assigned (partially in, partially out). The process of transforming gathered raw data about cases into membership scores is called calibration (Thiem and Dusa, 2013). It prescribes the definition of three qualitative thresholds: full membership, the cross-over point, and full non-membership. The crossover point, contrary to most accepted measurement scales, establishes a difference in kind, not degree. It is the score that indicates maximum ambiguity, that is, a firm has a degree of membership of 0.5 and also a degree of non-membership of 0.5 ini the given set. (Jacobs, 2018).</p>
<p>When the data is calibrated into sets, QCA then relies on Boolean algebra to perform systematic cross-case analysis, and using reduction shows combinations that are necessary and or sufficient for the occurrence of an outcome (Rihoux &amp; Ragin, 2009). Finally, QCA as an approach (rather than only an analytical method) requires the results to be verified by case knowledge and by counterfactual analysis making it explicit what assumptions have been made about logical remainders (i.e. configurations that were not observed, yet are analytically possible) (Schneider and Rohlfing, 2013).</p>
<p>The two following observations led to concluding that configurational approach is the most appropriate for our analytical framework: 1) The conceptualization of business models as a set of decision variables makes it a naturally configurational concept; 2) Both paradox theory and business model perspective oppose the contingency theory assumptions, i.e. “if-then” and “net-effects”, and instead look at the interaction between structures and practices and assume equifinality - idea that multiple configurations can have similar outcomes (Fiss et al., 2013; Nenonen and Storbacka, 2010; Lewis and Smith, 2014; T??uscher, 2017).</p>
<p>Despite the apparent fit, not much configurational work exists in both areas. Even less so when it comes to linking the two streams. In paradox scholarship, the idea that organizations need both integrating and separating strategies is rather new, therefore not much research beyond theory building exists. In the case of business models, there has been a lack of methods that can empirically do justice to the complexity and configrutional nature of the concept. The lack of appropriate analytical tools has been a general problem of naturally configurational concepts. However, as argued by Fiss (2007) and Misangyi et al. (2017), the development of methods such as QCA and NCA has given rise to neoconfigurational perspective, allowing embracing causal complexity appropriately. These developments have paved the way to some recent applications of QCA in business model literature (T??uscher, 2017; Kulins et al, 2016; Aversa et al, 2015).</p>

<p>The interview sample was targeted with diversity as the main criteria. In order to evaluate the sustainability of their performance, the firms were at least 5 years old and with a minimum of 5 full time employees. The first cases were gathered in the various subsectors of design and then further extended to other creative services, e.g. advertisement agencies, interactive and digital design consultancies. The semi-structured interviews with the founders or managers of the selected firms were conducted in 2015 and 2016, and lasted between 60 and 180 minutes. The interview guide was developed based on a prior literature review on business models, paradox management and the management characteristics of creative services firms. These interviews were transcribed, coded and analyzed using RQDA package in R. They were complemented with secondary data from websites, notes from various events where firms participated and reports. An overview of interview cases is provided in Appendix A.</p>
<p>The interview data was used to develop measures for paradox management that could be used in survey research. It was distributed between June 2017 and March 2018. The survey was sent out to an initial sample of 125 members of Dutch Designers’ Association (n=25), and a follow up sample of a self-gathered data base of 6000 enterprises that according to the Dutch Chamber of Commerce have registered their activity as belonging to the creative service firms (n=115).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.3</span> Measures and calibration</h3>
<p>In order to convert our qualitative insights into conditions and cases suitable for a QCA, we followed the suggestions of Basurto and Speer (2012) on designing measures and calibration from interview data into sets. We first searched for specific first order themes (observable measures) operationalizing our analytical framework. We derived three types of qualitative observable measures - 1) business model measures, 2) performance measures, 3) and measures that would classify business model design choices in the two paradox management approaches of integration and differentiation (separation). Appendix B shows the qualitative measures. These were further used to aggregate the qualitative measures into survey questions.</p>
<p>All the measures for conditions used in this study (Table 4.2) were single-item, measured on a 7-point Likert scale, asking the respondents to indicate the extent to which the statements are true about their business. In order to calibrate the data into sets, we used direct calibration setting 4 as the first inclusion score in the set “differentiation”. The non-membership would mean that the firms use an integration strategy with respect to the particular decision.</p>
