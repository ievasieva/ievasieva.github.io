# CONCLUSIONS {#conclusions}  
  
Intro to conclusions.   

##Summary of results

In the first paper, we explored the different forms the two generic approaches to paradox management - integration and differentiation - can take up, and how they are applied to making decisions about business models. We found 4 integration and 3 differentiationg tactics. The results invite to: 
- connect business model design with "the battle of the souls"
- engage creatively with managing paradoxical goals  
- be more conscious of the oppotunities, but also downsides of applying any of the decision-making tactics   
- learn from the in-depth accounts of the case study    


The findings of Paper 3 connect with the discussion on design themes, that certain business models are designed for certain objectives. The traditional business models more creative, the focus on revenue model diversification makes them more "commercial" etc.
