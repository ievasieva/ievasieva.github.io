<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>This thesis explores the decisions top-managers make about their firms’ business models in the presence of strategic dualities of a particular kind - paradoxes. <em>Strategic paradoxes</em> denote competing, conflicting, yet interrelated strategic goals, which cause tensions as a result of seemingly irreconcilable requirements and persist over time <span class="citation">(W. K. Smith and Lewis <a href="#ref-Smith2011">2011</a>; Lewis and Smith <a href="#ref-Lewis2014">2014</a>; Jarzabkowski, Le, and Van de Ven <a href="#ref-Jarzabkowski2013">2013</a>)</span>. While I study the conflict between creativity and commercialization in creative service firms<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, the work presented in this thesis is driven by a broader question, namely - how can firms use business model design to make conflicting, yet interdependent startegies work? I strongly believe this question is relevant beyond the studied field, as incorporating beyond-profit considerations, mostly social and environmental, in enteprise design is (hopefully) on its way of becoming the norm.</p>
<p>To explore the process and content of business model design for startegic dualities, I use paradox theory as a lens, and creative industries as an examplary <em>paradoxical setting</em>. This topic is investigated through one conceptual and three empirical studies, each using different methods. In the consequent sections I explain the main theoretical and methodic assumptions this thesis relies on. I address three questions in particular - 1) Why paradoxes? 2) Why business models? 3) How should we conceptualize organizations in order to study the relationship between the two?</p>
<div id="encountering-and-studying-paradoxes-why" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Encountering and studying paradoxes: Why?</h2>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress. (Niels Bohr, 1885 - 1962)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In line with <span class="citation">Fairhurst et al. (<a href="#ref-Fairhurst2016">2016</a>)</span>, paradox can be defined ‘as persistent contradiction between interdependent elements’(p.10). <span style="color:red">More intro on paradoxes of our time…..</span></p>
<p>The introductory quote was part of Niels Bohr’s response to Einstein’s famous thought experiment ‘Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical reality Be Considered Complete?’ <span class="citation">(Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen <a href="#ref-Einstein1935">1935</a>)</span>. In this article, Einstein put forward what he considered a fundamental <em>flaw</em> in the quantum mechanics. As he argued, the idea that the measurement performed on one particle from an interacting pair would affect the state of the other particle in the same way, no matter what the distance between them, was untenable, as it would have meant that information is transmitted faster than the speed of light, thereby defying the Theory of Relativity. In short - the main premise of the new-born quantum mechanics field seemed counterintuitive, and hence could not be true. However, this is, in fact, now known as the <em>EPR paradox</em>, and is one of the best-known examples illustrating the concept of <em>quantum entanglement</em>. But what does quantum mechanics have in common with the study of organizational paradoxes? Besides being a beautiful quote about the opportunities paradoxical encounters can offer, the presented context in which Bohr wrote these words perfectly highlights three cornerstones of this thesis:</p>
<p>First, paradoxes are a prevalent part of human experience, whether it would be the development of theoretical physics, study of organizational behavior and decision-making, or our daily lives. As in the case of the EPR Paradox, we cannot dismiss their existence only because they go against our perceived ideas about the reality. The famous management scholar Charles Handy referred to the contemporary times as the <em>Age of Paradox</em> <span class="citation">(Handy <a href="#ref-Handy1995">1995</a>)</span> already more than 20 years ago. According to the author, ‘paradox has almost become a cliche of our times. The word crops up again and again as people look for a way to describe the dilemmas facing the governments, businesses, and, increasingly, individuals.’ (p.xi). Consequently, while most of business studies, particularly in the domain of strategy, rely on the established profit-maximization paradigm, it does not mean that it is the right paradigm to describe all the challenges facing contemporary firms.</p>
<p>Second, the discovery of a paradox, and above all - the acceptance of it, as Bohr rightly noted, paved the way of many new scientific discoveries that nowadays constitute a big part of physics as a scientific discipline. In a similar vein, the rich and growing body of research relying on the paradox theory <span class="citation">(Lewis and Smith <a href="#ref-Lewis2014">2014</a>)</span> and related theories for explaining many organizational phenomena has proved that the paradox perspective can help to look at many troublesome questions from a fresh point of view. Scholars have successfully shown how paradox theory can assist in re-framing our understanding of the relationship between phenomena like science and commerce <span class="citation">(Bednarek, Paroutis, and Sillince <a href="#ref-Bednarek2017">2017</a>)</span>, exploration and exploitation <span class="citation">(Papachroni, Heracleous, and Paroutis <a href="#ref-Papachroni2015">2015</a>)</span>, control and collaboartion in the context of governance <span class="citation">(Sundaramurthy and Lewis <a href="#ref-Sundaramurthy2003">2003</a>)</span>, and many others. Studies so far have extensively dealt with the very nature and implications of paradoxical tensions <span class="citation">(Poole and Van de Ven <a href="#ref-Poole1989">1989</a>; W. K. Smith and Lewis <a href="#ref-Smith2011">2011</a>)</span>. Building on that, authors have made conclusions about the leadership styles <span class="citation">(Lewis and Smith <a href="#ref-Lewis2014">2014</a>)</span> and structures <span class="citation">(Ebbers and Wijnberg <a href="#ref-Ebbers2017">2017</a>)</span> needed in order to manage paradoxes, mindsets that help to accommodate paradoxical thinking <span class="citation">(Miron-Spektor et al. <a href="#ref-Miron2017">2017</a>)</span>, rethorical devices <span class="citation">(Bednarek, Paroutis, and Sillince <a href="#ref-Bednarek2017">2017</a>)</span>, identity work <span class="citation">(Gotsi et al. <a href="#ref-Gotsi2010">2010</a>)</span>, innovation management <span class="citation">(Andriopoulos and Lewis <a href="#ref-Andriopoulos2009">2009</a>)</span> and more. Yet surprisingly, the topic of this thesis - strategic decision-making about business models - has so far received very little conceptual and almost no empirical attention. This is hence the gap we try to fill.</p>
<p>Third, the main object of dispute between Bohr and Einstein - quantum entanglement - has surprisingly a lot in common with the main object of this research - strategic paradoxes. ‘<em>Quantum entanglement</em> is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which the quantum states of two or more objects have to be described with reference to each other, even though the individual objects may be spatially separated.’ <em>Strategic paradoxes</em>, in turn, denote inherently contradictory, yet inseparable and interdependant objectives that an organization is pursuing <span class="citation">(Bednarek, Paroutis, and Sillince <a href="#ref-Bednarek2017">2017</a>)</span>. In both cases we are dealing with the relationship between two (or more) interconnected elements, their influence over each other, and the way we interpret the nature and outcomes of this interaction. Although very different from each other, both theories share the idea that it is impossible and useless to observe or perform a measurement on a single part of an interrelated whole. When it comes to organizational life, this invites us to dismiss the separatist approaches, attempt to observe the integrity of processes, and embrace the paradoxical nature of strategic decision-making.</p>
