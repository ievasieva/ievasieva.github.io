Strategic paradoxes denote competing, conflicting, yet interrelated strategic goals, which cause tensions as a result of seemingly irreconcilable requirements and persist over time (W. K. Smith and Lewis 2011; Lewis and Smith 2014; Jarzabkowski, Le, and Van de Ven 2013). While I study the conflict between creativity and commercialization in creative service firms1, the work presented in this thesis is driven by a broader question, namely - how can firms use business model design to make conflicting, yet interdependent startegies work? I strongly believe this question is relevant beyond the studied field, as incorporating beyond-profit considerations, mostly social and environmental, in enteprise design is (hopefully) on its way of becoming the norm. To explore the process and content of business model design for startegic dualities, I use paradox theory as a lens, and creative industries as an examplary paradoxical setting. This topic is investigated through one conceptual and three empirical studies, each using different methods. In the consequent sections I explain the main theoretical and methodic assumptions this thesis relies on. I address three questions in particular - 1) Why paradoxes? 2) Why business models? 3) How should we conceptualize organizations in order to study the relationship between the two? 1.1 Encountering and studying paradoxes: Why? How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress. (Niels Bohr, 1885 - 1962) In line with Fairhurst et al. (2016), paradox can be defined ‘as persistent contradiction between interdependent elements’(p.10). More intro on paradoxes of our time….. The introductory quote was part of Niels Bohr’s response to Einstein’s famous thought experiment ‘Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical reality Be Considered Complete?’ (Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen 1935). In this article, Einstein put forward what he considered a fundamental flaw in the quantum mechanics. As he argued, the idea that the measurement performed on one particle from an interacting pair would affect the state of the other particle in the same way, no matter what the distance between them, was untenable, as it would have meant that information is transmitted faster than the speed of light, thereby defying the Theory of Relativity. In short - the main premise of the new-born quantum mechanics field seemed counterintuitive, and hence could not be true. However, this is, in fact, now known as the EPR paradox, and is one of the best-known examples illustrating the concept of quantum entanglement. But what does quantum mechanics have in common with the study of organizational paradoxes? Besides being a beautiful quote about the opportunities paradoxical encounters can offer, the presented context in which Bohr wrote these words perfectly highlights three cornerstones of this thesis: First, paradoxes are a prevalent part of human experience, whether it would be the development of theoretical physics, study of organizational behavior and decision-making, or our daily lives. As in the case of the EPR Paradox, we cannot dismiss their existence only because they go against our perceived ideas about the reality. The famous management scholar Charles Handy referred to the contemporary times as the Age of Paradox (Handy 1995) already more than 20 years ago. According to the author, ‘paradox has almost become a cliche of our times. The word crops up again and again as people look for a way to describe the dilemmas facing the governments, businesses, and, increasingly, individuals.’ (p.xi). Consequently, while most of business studies, particularly in the domain of strategy, rely on the established profit-maximization paradigm, it does not mean that it is the right paradigm to describe all the challenges facing contemporary firms. Second, the discovery of a paradox, and above all - the acceptance of it, as Bohr rightly noted, paved the way of many new scientific discoveries that nowadays constitute a big part of physics as a scientific discipline. In a similar vein, the rich and growing body of research relying on the paradox theory (Lewis and Smith 2014) and related theories for explaining many organizational phenomena has proved that the paradox perspective can help to look at many troublesome questions from a fresh point of view. Scholars have successfully shown how paradox theory can assist in re-framing our understanding of the relationship between phenomena like science and commerce (Bednarek, Paroutis, and Sillince 2017), exploration and exploitation (Papachroni, Heracleous, and Paroutis 2015), control and collaboartion in the context of governance (Sundaramurthy and Lewis 2003), and many others. Studies so far have extensively dealt with the very nature and implications of paradoxical tensions (Poole and Van de Ven 1989; W. K. Smith and Lewis 2011). Building on that, authors have made conclusions about the leadership styles (Lewis and Smith 2014) and structures (Ebbers and Wijnberg 2017) needed in order to manage paradoxes, mindsets that help to accommodate paradoxical thinking (Miron-Spektor et al. 2017), rethorical devices (Bednarek, Paroutis, and Sillince 2017), identity work (Gotsi et al. 2010), innovation management (Andriopoulos and Lewis 2009) and more. Yet surprisingly, the topic of this thesis - strategic decision-making about business models - has so far received very little conceptual and almost no empirical attention. This is hence the gap we try to fill. Third, the main object of dispute between Bohr and Einstein - quantum entanglement - has surprisingly a lot in common with the main object of this research - strategic paradoxes. ‘Quantum entanglement is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which the quantum states of two or more objects have to be described with reference to each other, even though the individual objects may be spatially separated.’ Strategic paradoxes, in turn, denote inherently contradictory, yet inseparable and interdependant objectives that an organization is pursuing (Bednarek, Paroutis, and Sillince 2017). In both cases we are dealing with the relationship between two (or more) interconnected elements, their influence over each other, and the way we interpret the nature and outcomes of this interaction. Although very different from each other, both theories share the idea that it is impossible and useless to observe or perform a measurement on a single part of an interrelated whole. When it comes to organizational life, this invites us to dismiss the separatist approaches, attempt to observe the integrity of processes, and embrace the paradoxical nature of strategic decision-making. 1.2 Framing strategic conflicts Contrasting trade-off and both/and perspectives. Start with examples. Learn and perform, plan and do, short-term and long-term, explore and exploit. These are just few of the paradoxed that have been explored by scholars and that are inherent to the life of every organization. How have we studied them so far? –&gt; Trade-off. What are the implications? What does paradox perspective offer? What changes if we frame them differently? The first paper of this thesis tackles exactly this topic. 1.3 Pursuing conflicting goals What does the strategic management literature tell us about pursuing conflicting strategies? -frustrating etc. In the end, organizations need to come up with coping mechanisms, balancing acts, as “usual” decision-making strategies do not work. 1.4 Approaches to coping with the paradox Integration and separation at different levels. 1.5 Business modelling for complexity Why study business models? And how can we make them fit complex strategic intents? 1.6 Heterogeneity of organizationl commitments and performance implications Do differences in the importance that are attached to each of the dimensions lead to business model heterogeneity? And what are the performance implications? 1.7 Purpose and overview of the thesis Chapter Research Question Research Approach Data Contributions 1 Thriving off of Tensions How can paradox perspective enrich creative industries research?
